# python-name-sorter
A Python command-line program that sorts names in a .txt file in ascending order first by the length of the name, and then alphabetically.

1. Put the namesorter.py source code file in the same folder as the Sort Me.txt file.

2. Run WSL and use the cd command to access the directory of the folder in the console.

3. Type "python3 namesorter.py --sort 'yourfilename.txt'" to sort the text normally or "python3 namesorter.py --rev 'yourfilename.txt'" to sort the text in reverse order into the console and enter.

4. You can type "python3 namesorter.py -h" into the console and enter for more detailed help options.
