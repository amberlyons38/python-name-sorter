# python-name-sorter
A Python command-line program that can sort names in a .txt file in ascending order first by the length of the name, and then alphabetically or in reverse order by length and alphabetically.

1. Put the namesorter.py source code file in the same folder as the Sort Me.txt file.

2. Run WSL and use the cd command to access the directory of the folder in the console.

3. Type "python3 namesorter.py --sort 'yourfilename.txt'" to sort the text normally or "python3 namesorter.py --rev 'yourfilename.txt'" to sort the text in reverse order into the console and enter.

4. To test the program, download the "Sort Me.txt" file, "Sorted Text.txt" file, and the "Sorted Text Rev.txt" file and put them in the same folder as namesorter.py. Type "python3 namesorter.py --test 'n'" to test the normal sort or type "python3 namesorter.py --test 'r'" to test the reverse sort. The results of the test will print out to the console.

5. You can type "python3 namesorter.py -h" into the console and enter for more detailed help options.
